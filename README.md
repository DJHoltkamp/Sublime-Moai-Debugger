# Sublime Moai-Debug

Sublime 3 plug-in for interacting with the Moai.

## Features

- Automatically display scope variables and stack trace
- Debugging layout for stack and variables
- Click variable to inspect value (in progress)
- Currently tested under OSX and Sublime Text 3


## Quick start

NOTE: We are working to get the install to work right with the package manager. For now, you must manually place the debugger in the Packages folder under the name Moai Debugger.

### Debugger control menu

When the plug-in is installed correctly, all the options can be found under the Moai menu item in the top bar.
