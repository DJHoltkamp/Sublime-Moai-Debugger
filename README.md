## Quick start

We recommend using the PackageControl plugin to install this plugin:
http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation#ST3

Be sure to follow the SublimeText 3 instructions


After Install:
1. Make sure Moai is in your system PATH 
2. Make sure this is installed under "Packages/Moai Debugger/" (This will be automatic if you used package control)
3. Make sure your Moai project has a main.lua in the root folder
4. This is a Sublime 3 Plug-in for OSX. Other platforms may work but are untested

### Debugger control menu

When the plug-in is installed correctly, all the options can be found under the Moai menu item in the top bar.
