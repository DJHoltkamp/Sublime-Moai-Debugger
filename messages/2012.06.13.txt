Xdebug 2012.06.13 Changelog
===========================

The project settings format has changed. The xdebug key should now be
contained in the "settings" key within the .sublime-project file. For example:

    {
        "folders":
        [
            {
                "path": "..."
            }
        ],

        "settings": {
            "xdebug": { "url": "http://..." }
        }
    }

With this change, .sublime-project files no longer need to be in the root
folder of your project.
